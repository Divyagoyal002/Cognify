#### Internship Tasks

Welcome to the repository documenting my internship tasks completed at Cognifyz Technologies, focusing on advanced machine learning applications in restaurant data analytics.

## Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings

**Objective:** Develop a predictive model for restaurant ratings using supervised learning techniques.

- **Steps:**
  - Conducted data preprocessing, addressing missing values and applying categorical encoding to prepare the dataset.
  - Implemented a linear regression model, leveraging cross-validation techniques to optimize hyperparameters and mitigate overfitting.
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared).
  - Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings.

## Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

**Objective:** Build a personalized recommendation system based on user preferences and restaurant characteristics.

- **Steps:**
  - Utilized collaborative filtering and content-based methods to preprocess and filter restaurant data.
  - Implemented content-based filtering by constructing user profiles and recommending restaurants based on similarity metrics derived from cuisine preferences and price ranges.
  - Evaluated recommendation quality through metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, considering varying user preferences and feedback loops.

## Task 3: Cuisine Classification

**Objective:** Develop a multi-class classification model to categorize restaurants by cuisine type.

- **Steps:**
  - Preprocessed restaurant data by handling missing values and employing one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  - Applied logistic regression and evaluated model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Conducted analysis to understand model behavior across diverse cuisine categories, addressing class imbalance and exploring feature importance.

## Task 4: Location-based Analysis

**Objective:** Perform spatial analysis to derive insights into restaurant distribution and performance across different geographical regions.

- **Steps:**
  - Leveraged geospatial data visualization techniques to map restaurant locations using latitude and longitude coordinates.
  - Employed clustering algorithms to identify hotspots and spatial patterns in restaurant density and average ratings.
  - Conducted statistical analysis to compare restaurant metrics such as average ratings, cuisine variety, and price ranges across different cities or localities.
